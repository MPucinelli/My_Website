    subtitle: "We aim to consolidate information from both international and local news sources, examining the impact of global events
through the domestic lenses of the countries which we cover.
Our Vision is to be able to cover important economies from all around the world in search of investment opportunities to present to our readers.
We hope that by doing this, we can bring more attention to
possible investment opportunities in countries not typically (or
frequently) covered by mainstream media."
