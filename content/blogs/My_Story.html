<h2>About ME</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Mario - Founder and CEO of Finance Fast Track Magazine.</p>
<p>I would like to welcome you to our website, where we hope to provide useful information.</p>
<p>Before exploring the rest of our offering, I’d like to give some background about myself.</p>
<p>I am a Brazilian national, born and raised in the city of São Paulo, where I was raised for 11 years of my life. There, I learned Portuguese and enjoyed the many warm and sunny days that my homeland can provide. Even today, I can’t say there has been a better view than the SP skyline (I mean, look at this!)</p>

My first great life shift occurred when my sister was accepted into Rollins College. It had always been my family’s dream to live in the United States (especially near Disney World), and considering the circumstances, they took the opportunity to move the entire family there.</p>

I studied there for about 4 years, up until my parents decided to move us to Europe. This was because my sister had now finished college and they weren’t happy with the education my brother and I were having access to. Further, because my father has a Portuguese citizenship, me and my siblings also had access to one, and since the UK was still part of the EU at the time, it seemed like the most optimal place to move to.</p>
<p>I have since lived in the UK for 6 years, finishing my high school and university education here. I studied Politics and Economics at the University of Nottingham, finishing it in 2020. Our main building is very beautiful - much like LBS’s!</p>

<p>Now I am studying Financial Analysis at London Business School, after which I hope to get into Investment Banking!</p>
